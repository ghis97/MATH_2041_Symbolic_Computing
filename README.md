# MATH_2041_Final_Project
# We wanted to show how the Maple software can simplify solving complex operations that can require many tedious steps and techniques from different areas of mathematics. We created a procedure that uses summations, matrix operations and linear algebra for statistical purposes. With concepts of regression analysis for polynomials, our procedure takes as inputs two data lists and an x-value X. Computes the sums needed to create a system of 3 linear equations which the uknowns yeild the coefficients of a least squares polynomial of degree 2. It then uses Gaussian elimination and backward substitution to find the unknowns and the resulting polynomial. It evaluates the quadratic model at the given x-value and outputs the result and a graph of the data points, including the point with the given x-value on the curve. This procedure can be used to predict any y-value corresponding to a given x-value for sets of data points that are appropriate for 2nd degree polynomial least squares approximation.
